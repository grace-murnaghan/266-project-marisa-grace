kates et al., 2012). changing objectives often involves a deteriorating standard of living, the loss of cultural values, and the disintegration of commonly held values and practices in the community. accepting loss and damage often means falling incomes, assets, education levels and social status, along with greater poverty, lower food consumption, and diminished future prospects. undertaking more significant transformation can involve more permanent migration out of one's home area, leading to other significant changes in livelihood and social systems.\",\n          \"the context within which nordhaus's paper was written helps us understand its contribution. while the basic science of the greenhouse effect was set out in the nineteenth century by fourier, tyndall and arrhenius, discussions surrounding the possible role of humans in enhancing it - and therefore causing global warming and climate change - began in earnest in the 1970s. for at least a decade, climate change remained largely a scientific/environmentalist's issue, debated in specialist conferences and networks (agrawala, 1998). indeed, it is important to stress that the science of climate change was running years ahead of the economics (something that arguably remains the case today in understanding the impacts of climate change;
