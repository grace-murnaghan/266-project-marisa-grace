adaptation is taking place in developed nations. we find limited evidence of adaptation action. where interventions are being implemented and reported on, they are typically in sectors that are sensitive to climate impacts, are most common at the municipal level, facilitated by higher-level government interventions, with responses typically institutional in nature. there is negligible description of adaptation taking place with respect to vulnerable groups, with reporting unequal by region and sector. the methodology offers important insights for meta-analyses in climate change scholarship and can be used for monitoring progress in adaptation over time. 1 adaptation is necessary if we are to manage the risks posed by climate change (new et al. 2011 smith et al. 2011 ). what we know about adaptation, however, is limited. while there is an emerging scholarship proposing assessment approaches and adaptation options, few studies have systematically examined actual adaptation actions at a national or regional level. is adaptation taking place? what types of interventions are being implemented? what factors are motivating adaptation? the assessment reports of the ipcc contain information on these questions, but using the ipcc to examine, compare, and monitor if and how adaptation is taking place presents a number of challenges. while ipcc assessments are rigorous and comprehensive, critiques have highlighted the opacity of selection criteria for literature included\",\n          \"major uncertainties the human health consequences of aging water infrastructure failure depend not only on the local and regional climate factors that contribute to damage or capacity challenges but also the nature of the system and the pressures on it, the population affected, and the timeliness and adequacy of the response--all of which are inherently local or regional factors. due to the complicated local and regional specificity, there are no national projections of the human health impact of water infrastructure failure. uncertainty remains regarding appropriate methods for projecting changes in illness rates, including how to integrate considerations of human behavior into modeling (current methods to assess exposure risk assume similar human behavior across time scales and geography). methodological challenges are related to 1) baseline case reporting issues (underreporting and underdiagnosis), 2) accounting for the effects of potential adaptation strategies/public health interventions (for example, mitigating risk with improvements to current water and sewerage systems), and 3) accounting for changes in public healthcare infrastructure and access that can reduce the risk of exposure or of illness/death if exposed. assessment of confidence based on evidence based on the evidence found in the peer-reviewed literature, there is high confidence that the anticipated climate change related increases in some extreme weather events and in storm surge will increase the risk that water infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater will fail through either damage or exceedance of system capacity, with aging infrastructure being particularly vulnerable. evidence shows contamination to or from these systems occurs with heavy precipitation and other extreme weather events. there is consistent qualitative evidence suggesting that projected climate change effects on extreme weather patterns-- particularly extreme precipitation and storm surge--can adversely affect water infrastructure and lead to increased loading of pathogens, algal toxins, and contaminants. however, there are no national-level studies upon which to draw conclusions regarding quantitative projections of increased exposure. thus, the limited number of studies supports a medium confidence level regarding risk of exposure.\",\n          \"climate change is projected to have far-reaching impacts on ecosystems and their species (fischlin et al., 2007), but although species have a certain capacity to adapt autonomously, this is often limited and can be adversely affected by actions undertaken in other sectors. human intervention, therefore, will be necessary to enhance this adaptation and to maximise the security of ecosystems and the services which they provide. this chapter analyses the various issues, assumptions and methods surrounding existing studies of global costings of adaptation, and, in particular, critically evaluates the unfccc study on natural ecosystems. these were not included in the

adaptation is taking place in developed nations. we find limited evidence of adaptation action. where interventions are being implemented and reported on, they are typically in sectors that are sensitive to climate impacts, are most common at the municipal level, facilitated by higher-level government interventions, with responses typically institutional in nature. there is negligible description of adaptation taking place with respect to vulnerable groups, with reporting unequal by region and sector. the methodology offers important insights for meta-analyses in climate change scholarship and can be used for monitoring progress in adaptation over time. 1 adaptation is necessary if we are to manage the risks posed by climate change (new et al. 2011 smith et al. 2011 ). what we know about adaptation, however, is limited. while there is an emerging scholarship proposing assessment approaches and adaptation options, few studies have systematically examined actual adaptation actions at a national or regional level. is adaptation taking place? what types of interventions are being implemented? what factors are motivating adaptation? the assessment reports of the ipcc contain information on these questions, but using the ipcc to examine, compare, and monitor if and how adaptation is taking place presents a number of challenges. while ipcc assessments are rigorous and comprehensive, critiques have highlighted the opacity of selection criteria for literature included\",\n          \"major uncertainties the human health consequences of aging water infrastructure failure depend not only on the local and regional climate factors that contribute to damage or capacity challenges but also the nature of the system and the pressures on it, the population affected, and the timeliness and adequacy of the response--all of which are inherently local or regional factors. due to the complicated local and regional specificity, there are no national projections of the human health impact of water infrastructure failure. uncertainty remains regarding appropriate methods for projecting changes in illness rates, including how to integrate considerations of human behavior into modeling (current methods to assess exposure risk assume similar human behavior across time scales and geography). methodological challenges are related to 1) baseline case reporting issues (underreporting and underdiagnosis), 2) accounting for the effects of potential adaptation strategies/public health interventions (for example, mitigating risk with improvements to current water and sewerage systems), and 3) accounting for changes in public healthcare infrastructure and access that can reduce the risk of exposure or of illness/death if exposed. assessment of confidence based on evidence based on the evidence found in the peer-reviewed literature, there is high confidence that the anticipated climate change related increases in some extreme weather events and in storm surge will increase the risk that water infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater will fail through either damage or exceedance of system capacity, with aging infrastructure being particularly vulnerable. evidence shows contamination to or from these systems occurs with heavy precipitation and other extreme weather events. there is consistent qualitative evidence suggesting that projected climate change effects on extreme weather patterns-- particularly extreme precipitation and storm surge--can adversely affect water infrastructure and lead to increased loading of pathogens, algal toxins, and contaminants. however, there are no national-level studies upon which to draw conclusions regarding quantitative projections of increased exposure. thus, the limited number of studies supports a medium confidence level regarding risk of exposure.\",\n          \"climate change is projected to have far-reaching impacts on ecosystems and their species (fischlin et al., 2007), but although species have a certain capacity to adapt autonomously, this is often limited and can be adversely affected by actions undertaken in other sectors. human intervention, therefore, will be necessary to enhance this adaptation and to maximise the security of ecosystems and the services which they provide. this chapter analyses the various issues, assumptions and methods surrounding existing studies of global costings of adaptation, and, in particular, critically evaluates the unfccc study on natural ecosystems. these were not included in the
