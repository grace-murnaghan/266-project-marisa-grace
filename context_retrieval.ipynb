      "correct context: the distinction between impactand intent-oriented proenvironmental behaviors is important, but, until recently, had not received much attention. it may partly account for the often observed weak association between environmental attitudes and proenvironmental behavior. for example, environment-friendly actions sometimes are undertaken for nonenvironment-related motives (e.g., a person who cycles for health, not for climate reasons).53intent-oriented behavior, which focuses on the actor's intention, and impact-oriented behavior, which focuses on the behavior's environmental impact,28do not always overlap. in a large-scale survey, for example, a marked discrepancy was observed between the percentage of respondents who stated that they engage in proenvironmental action specifically out of concern about climate change (31%) and the percentage of respondents who stated that they perform what are considered to be 'energy conservation behaviors' (96%).53these findings suggest that a great deal of ghg-mitigating behaviors may not necessarily, or consciously, be performed for the sake of the environment per se furthermore, intent-oriented environmental actions typically are determined by attitudes, whereas impact-oriented behaviors tend to be\n",
